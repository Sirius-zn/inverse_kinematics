Final Project
=============

Overview
--------
My report can be found at final_report/final_report.pdf, which describes my
project in detail.

A comprehensive video demonstrating my features can be found at
output/complex_structure_animation.mkv.

I have also included two sample animations generated by my project at
output/cool_animation.mkv, and output/running.mkv.

cool_animation.mkv is the animation I created in the demonstration video, and
running.mkv is an animation I created by looking at still frames of a man
running.
